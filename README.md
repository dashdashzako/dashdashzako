### Hi! I'm Damien 👋

Small 🐟 swimming in the Web pond.

I'm a frontend developer from 🇫🇷 with a passion about web accessibility.\
The _"Can this be used in that situation?"_ developer arguing with designers and messing with pull requests.

You can reach me in French, Japanese, or any flavour of English.\
But if I were you wouldn't do so, I'm despicable.
